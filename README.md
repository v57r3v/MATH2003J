Θ      Question   1:
Determine   whether   each   of the   following   is   True   or   False.
(a)   The   set   S1   = {(x,y,   z) ∈ R3    : x2    + 2y2   + 3z2   ≤   12}   is   closed   and   bounded.
(b)   The   set   S2   = {(x,y,   z) ∈ R3    : 2x + y − z   ≤   10}   is   closed   and   bounded.
(c)   The   set   S3   = {(x,y,   z) ∈ R3    : x2   + y2   + z2   < 25}   is   closed   and   bounded.

Θ      Question   2:
(I)   Let   S1   =   {(x,   y) ∈ R2      : x2   +   y2    ≥ 1}.    Is   S1    closed   and/or   bounded?    Give   an   example   of   a   continuous   function   f   : S1   → R   which   does   not   achieve   a   maximum   nor   a   minimum on   the   set   S1   .
(II)   Let   S2      =   {(x,y,   z)   ∈   R3      :   x2   + y2   + z2      <   1}.      Is   S2      closed   and/or   bounded?     代 写MATH2003J, OPTIMIZATION IN ECONOMICS, BDIC 2023/2024, SPRING Problem Sheet 9Prolog
代做程序编程语言 Give   an   example   of a   continuous   function   g   : S2    → R   which   does   not   achieve   a   maximum   nor   a   minimum   on   the   set   S2   .

(II)   Find the   maximum   and   mininimum   of f   subject to   the   above   constraint.

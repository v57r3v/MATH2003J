Θ      Question   1:
Use   the   method   of   Lagrange   multipliers   to   find   the   maximum   and   minimum   of   f   (x,   y)   =   5x2   + 5y2   + 1   subject   to   the   constraint   xy   = 1.
Θ      Question   2:
Use   the   method   of   Lagrange   multipliers   to   find   the   maximum   and   minimum   of   f   (x,   y) = x+3y   subject   to   the   constraint   x2   +   y2   = 10.
Question   3:
Use   the   method   of   Lagrange   multipliers   to   find   the   maximum   and   minimum   of   f   (x,   y)   =   2x2   + 2y2   + 1   subject   to   the   constraint   x2   +   xy +   y2    = 6.
Θ      Question   4:
Use   the   method   of   Lagrange   multipliers   to   find   the   maximum   of   f   (x1   ,   x2   ,   x3   )   =   5x1x2x3   subject   to   the   constraint   x1   + 2x2   + 3x3   = 24.
Question   5:
Use   the   method   of   Lagrange   multipliers   to   find   the   maximum   and   minimum   of   f   (x,y,   z)   =   x + 2y + 2z   subject   to   the   constraint   x2   +   y2   + z2   = 9.
Θ      Question   6:
Use   the   method   of   Lagrange   multipliers   to   find   the   maximum   and   minimum   of   f   (w,   x,y,   z) =   w + x + y + z   subject   to   the   constraint   w2   + x2   + y2   +   z2   = 1.

代做程序编程语言ers   to   find   the   maximum   and   minimum   of   f   (x,y,   z) = y   subject   to   the   constraints   z   = x + y   and   2x2   + y2   + 2z2   = 8.
Θ      Question   8:
Find   the   minimum   of x2   − 2x + 2y2   + z2   + z   subject   to   the   constraints   x + y   + z   =   1               and                2x − y   − z   = 5.
Question   9:
Find   the   maximum   and   the   minimum   of   x   + 2y   subject   to   the   constraint   x2   +   y2   = c,   where   c is   a   positive   constant.   Explain   why   the   maximum   and   the   minimum   are   attained.
Θ      Question   10:
A   company   is   planning   to   sell   a   new   product   at   the   price   of      ¥125   per   unit   and   estimates that   if x   euro   is   spent   on   training   staff and   y   euro   is   spent   on   advertising   the   product,   then
y + 300/50y + x + 200/75x   units   of the   product   will   be   sold.   The   cost   of manufacturing   the   product   is      ¥45   per   unit.   If   the   company   has   a   total   of      ¥5,000 to   spend   on   training   staff   and   advertisement,   how   should this   money   be   allocated   to   generate   the   largest   possible   profit?
+   Note:   the   profit   function   is   given   by
(No.       of   units)    ×   (price   per   unit   -   cost   per   unit)   -   total   amount   spent   on   training   and advertisement
